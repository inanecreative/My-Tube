    <p>Wu-Tang Clan is an American hip hop collective formed in Staten Island, New York City, in 1992.[4] Its members include RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa, and, until his death in 2004, Ol' Dirty Bastard. Close affiliate Cappadonna later became an official member. They are credited for revitalizing East Coast hip hop[5][6] and are considered one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time.[7][8]
    After signing to Steve Rifkind's label Loud Records in 1992, Wu-Tang Clan released their debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) in 1993; initially receiving positive reviews, it has since garnered widespread critical acclaim and is widely considered to be one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.[9][10][11] Members of the group released solo albums between 1994 and 1996. In 1997, the group released their second album, Wu-Tang Forever. It debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. The group later released the albums The W (2000), Iron Flag (2001), 8 Diagrams (2007), and A Better Tomorrow (2014), to less popularity. The only copy of their seventh album, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin (2015), was purchased for $2 million by former hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli.[12]
    Wu-Tang Clan has introduced and launched the careers of a number of affiliated artists and groups, collectively known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees.[13] In 2008, About ranked Wu-Tang Clan the No. 1 greatest hip hop group of all time.[8] Kris Ex of Rolling Stone called Wu-Tang Clan "the best rap group ever".[14] In 2004, NME hailed them as one of the most influential groups of the last ten years.
